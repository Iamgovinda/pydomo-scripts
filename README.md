# üìä Domo Integration Scripts

This project automates the interaction between local Python scripts and the [Domo](https://www.domo.com/) data platform
using the official [`pydomo`](https://pypi.org/project/pydomo/) SDK. It
leverages [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for fast, modern, and reproducible Python dependency management.

---

## üöÄ Project Purpose

The goal of this project is to:

- Seamlessly connect to Domo using `pydomo`
- Upload and fetch data programmatically
- Perform transformations with `pandas`
- Maintain a fast and secure Python environment using `uv`

This project is useful for automating ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations between local systems and Domo.
